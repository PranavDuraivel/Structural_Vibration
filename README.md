# üì° Modal and Forced Vibration Analysis of a Telescopic Aerial (MDOF System)

This repository presents a finite element implementation for analysing the **free and forced vibrations** of a 3-element telescopic stainless steel aerial using the **Euler-Bernoulli beam theory** in 2D. The system is modelled as an MDOF (Multi-Degree of Freedom) system using beam elements with translational and rotational degrees of freedom.

## üß† Problem Overview

A **telescopic radio aerial** composed of 3 hollow concentric steel tubes (0.2 m each, total length 0.6 m) is analysed in flexure. Each tube is modelled using a **2D beam element** with two degrees of freedom per node: translational and rotational.

### Given:

| Tube | Outer Dia (mm) | Inner Dia (mm) |
|------|----------------|----------------|
| 1    | 2              | 1              |
| 2    | 3              | 2              |
| 3    | 4              | 3              |

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology

### 1. Finite Element Modelling
- Each beam element has **4 DOFs** (2 nodes √ó [translational + rotational])
- Global matrix size: **8√ó8**
- Mass matrix includes a **lumped 1g stopper mass** at the aerial tip (translational only)

### 2. Boundary Conditions
- The thick end (element 3) is **fixed (cantilevered)**  
- DOFs corresponding to this fixed node are removed from the global matrices

### 3. Eigenvalue Analysis
- Generalised eigenvalue problem solved using:
```python
from scipy.linalg import eigh
eigenvals, eigenvecs = eigh(K, M)
```
- Frequencies extracted from `sqrt(eigenvalues) / (2 * pi)`
- Mode shapes visualised for translational DOFs

### 4. Rayleigh Damping
To enforce Œ∂‚ÇÅ = Œ∂‚ÇÉ = 2%, Rayleigh damping coefficients `alpha`, `beta` are computed using:
```
[C] = alpha * [M] + beta * [K]
```
Damping for 2nd mode is estimated using:
```
Œ∂‚ÇÇ = 0.5 * (alpha / œâ‚ÇÇ + beta * œâ‚ÇÇ)
```

### 5. Forced Vibration Analysis
Using direct frequency response:
```
H(œâ) = [-œâ¬≤ * M + jœâC + K]‚Åª¬π
```
- Receptance computed between aerial tip and its neighbour node  
- Frequency sweep across first three modes  
- Results plotted in magnitude (dB) and phase

- Damping evident in amplitude reduction at high frequency

## üßæ Discussion

### üß© Observations:
- Two rigid body modes (translational & rotational) expected in the unconstrained model  
- Second mode has nodal point ~0.23 m from fixed end  
- Absence of anti-resonance suggests symmetric modal influence at the tip  

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Model Limitations:
- 2D assumption: real-world system behaves in 3D  
- Boundary assumptions: perfectly fixed in model vs real clamping flexibility  
- Material damping and external factors (e.g., air drag) neglected
